  I am a <a href="https://hpcc.ucr.edu/about/facility/people/#facility">proud Linux System Administrator</a> and F/OSS enthusiast, you can checkout my resume <a href="https://melasg.github.io/resume.html">by clicking here</a>.

<p>
  I'm a shameless distro-hopper, OSSEC perfectionist, LIDAR-scrambling-clothing-wearing, and endless project starter (call me the queen of ideas). <br /><br /><br />I have a list of a lot of projects I am currently trying to haphazardly document on my
  <a href="https://www.github.com/melasq/"> GitHub</a> link. Most of my hardware projects are not updated there (yet) due to the physical handiwork required plus organizing it neatly for my github takes time! Ask me about it!
</p>
<p>You can visit my LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melody-asghari/">here at LinkedIn.</a> <br /></p>

You can also contact me through email, at my school email (since I haven't graduated yet!)
masgh003@ucr.edu.

<p>Thanks for taking a glance & reading this far!</p>
