            <div>
              <ul>
                  <li>With another classmate for an extracurricular course, we took my RPi 4 and made a media server out of it from scratch without using containers/services that made it super easy. I was unsatisfied with the RPi 4's video codec transcoding speed, so I decided to use it in coordination with other electronic parts donated to me: 3 home PCs, 1 Classic MacPro (cheese grater), and had a few smartphones. </li>
                  <li>After researching for almost two days, I quickly learned and verified that there are almost no guides that focus on actually recycling the hardware of e-waste, or these guides require buying more parts, which is 100% against the very concept of my idea! TDP and overall energy consumption in mind, of course 100% recycling of 100% of parts is not feasible for a student living in their parents' home, but I've made a successful franken-server without spending anymore money. Proxmox, VMware ESXi, Ansible, and Docker are also integral to keeping it all together.</li>
